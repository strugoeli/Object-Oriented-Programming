BST.java - Application of binary search tree.
 With all the required attributes for binary trees, see below.

TreeIterator.java - Sub-class of BST which implements an
iterator that runs on all binary tree vertices in ascending
order.

Node.java - A sub-class representing the tree nodes.

=============================
BST - We decided to apply a parent class of a binary search
tree because all the AVL trees have the same attributes as
binary search trees. So if anyone wants to apply a modified AVL tree he will be able to make a heir class
search tree and will have less work.
The important methods of this class are:

Add () - Add a node.
Boolean method that returns true if added. The method takes a
node that we want to add, and calls contains().
If the given node is not in the binary search tree,
the method will check where to add it - 
whether it is larger than the last node in the contains run,
the method will add it to the right, if smaller -
add it to the left.

Delete  - Delete a node.
A boolean method that accepts a node that you want to remove
and calls contains (). If the node is in the binary search
tree, then the method has three options:

1. The node is a leaf. So we'll remove it and update the
height and size.

2. The node is a parent of one son - we will move the node
parent pointer to the node son, and remove the node.

3. The node has 2 sons. This is probably the most complicated
method. Here we use the successor method, it is responsible
for giving us the correct pointers, so that the tree will
continue to be a binary tree and the balance will not be
broken.

updateHeightAdd - A method that updates the height of the
tree after each relevant change.

contains - A method that accepts a node and returns
 if the given node is in the binary search tree or not.
This method is also common for add() and delete()- 
Because in both of these methods we need to know whether the
node is in the tree or not.

Successor methods - Methods that get a node, and find
the next as a follow. Used as delete (), because as soon as we
want to delete a node with 2 sons, we will need to find its
next node by connecting all the remaining vertices to the
correct places.

The interaction of all these methods with AVL tree is direct.
Each addition of node to an AVL tree is done exactly by adding
to a binary search tree, so deleting and contains.
The method that most likely affects the AVL trees is the tree
updateHeight. By adjusting the height of the tree, we will
know whether we need to fix the tree to maintain the AVL
feature.


 recursively for the right and the left son. after doing this pattern n time and the input will be a new tree
 with the sam parameters of the old tree and as the old tree is an AVL tree there is not need to make
 re-balance after each copying. after n running the running time complexity would be O(n)
