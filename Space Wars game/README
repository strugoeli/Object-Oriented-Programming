SpaceShipFactory.java - This class is responsible for the creation of the SpaceShip objects based on
                         the user's inputs

SpaceShip.java       - An abstract class which contains every method that is common for every SpaceShip object

extends from SpaceShip:

HumanShip.java      - This class represents a ship which controlled by the user.

DrunkShip.java      - This class represents a ship which driven by dunk pilot.
                      the ship is characterized by few drunk pattern that being chosen randomly.

WarFreakType.java   - This class represents ships with tendency to attack others.

PacifistType.java   - This class represents a ship tendency to run away from the fight


extends from PacifistType:

SpecialShip.java    - This class represents a ship with special ability - Electronic Warfare

RunnerShip.java     - This class represents a ship which driven by an runner pilot


extends from WarFreakType:

AggressiveShip.java - This class represents a ship which driven by an aggressive pilot

BasherShip.java     - This class represents a ship which driven by a pilot that tends to collide other ships.

=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the program in way that the abstract class Spaceship delegates responsibility to the other
classes that are involved in the process of creating the ships characters.
in addition I created two more class WarFreakType and Pacifist this makes another layer which grants us better
using of the code in the way we avoid repetition.
the advantage which this design grants us with modularity and makes it simple to update the code and adding
new type of ship characters.


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I made the Spaceship class to be an abstract class.in the Spaceship class I mainly implemented the methods
that are common for all ships characters, excluding the methods that are related to the special ship that are
common only to the WarFreakType ships, however I decided to implement those method in the SpaceShip
class in order to make it simpler to expand the special ship abilities to affect on the other ships in the
future.
In the WarFreakType and PacifistType I implemented methods that determines most of the ship of those type
movements.
I also implemented updates method for the most of the data members which again makes it simpler to change
the rules of the game in terms of the costs of the action,getting hit and the effects on the data
members after every round - by changing the constants.

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================

Drunk Ship:

The drunk ship has five different patterns to pick his move from. When the drunk ship is created it picks
randomly one of the five patterns by using Random object, and every time the ship's health level is reduced to
one last point the random mechanism activates once more and starts picking random moves from the five
patterns. in that way every time the is dead the pattern would be picked randomly again.

Special Ship:

I implemented the special ship to be a stealth aircraft when it faces against the war freak type of ships.
the special ship strategy is to activate it's electronic warfare ability whenever it possible( when it has
enough energy and the rounds restriction is off). in addition the ship always tries to avoid fighting, in that
 way it lets the other ships to fight and it gives it an advantage to survive the fight.
